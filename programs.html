            <h2>Deadlift Derby</h2>
            <img src="img/deadlift.jpg" alt="A person does a deadlift.">
            <p>There may be no exercise more practical than the deadlift. The weight is on the ground, and you just have to pick it up—or so you may think. In reality, there are a lot of nuances and variations involved in this seemingly rudimentary workout, and you can learn just about all of them in this six-week clinic.</p>
